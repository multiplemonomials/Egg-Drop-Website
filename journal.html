				<td> 1<sup>st</sup> Build Day </td>
				<td> 
					We decided on a cube around a double pyramid for our inner shell and a crush structure with a solid core and spikes to
					absorb shock for our outer shell. Alex, Hunter, and Drew immediately started building,
					and Jamie spent the first half of the class frantically making Pugh charts to keep up with their reasoning before joining in.
					By the end of the day, part of the crush structure and inner shell had been built.
				</td>

				<td> 11-2-2015 </td>
				<td> 1.5 hr </td>
				<td> 2<sup>nd</sup> Build Day </td>
				<td> 
					We spent the meeting working on the main structure.  We got the center piece finished, and attached it 
					to the bottom crush structure piece.  However, we realized the center piece to outside connection may be <em>too</em> strong,
					and doesn't absorb shock well.  We plan to try cutting one or more of the toothpicks on this connection.
				</td>

			<tr>
				<td> 11-3-2015 </td>
				<td> 1.5 hr </td>
				<td> 3<sup>rd</sup> (and final) Build Day </td>
				<td> 
					After the unexpected announcement that we would <strong>not</strong> be able to finish our egg drops at home after the meeting, we 
					started rushing to finish by the end of the period.  We were able to finish both halves and the center, join them, and get most of the
					spikes attached to the outside before we ran out of time.
