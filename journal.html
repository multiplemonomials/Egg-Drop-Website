				<td> We decided what our three prototypes would be and drew designs for them.  All three designs were finished by the end of class, and Mr. Corman gave us permission to start building them. </td>

				<td> Test Device Testing </td>
				<td> We constructed each of our three test designs this meeting. Jamie and Drew's and Alex's devices weren't finished by the end of class, but the egg survived being dropped from head height in all three.</td>

				<td> 10-31-2015 </td>
				<td> 1.5 hr </td>
				<td> 1<sup>st</sup> Build Day </td>
				<td> 
					We decided on a cube around a double pyramid for our inner shell and a crush structure with a solid core and spikes to
					absorb shock for our outer shell. Alex, Hunter, and Drew immediately started building,
					and Jamie spent the first half of the class frantically making Pugh charts to keep up with their reasoning before joining in on the build.
					By the end of the day, part of the crush structure and inner shell had been built.
				</td>

			<tr>
				<td> 11-2-2015 </td>
				<td> 1.5 hr </td>
				<td> 2<sup>nd</sup> Build Day </td>
				<td> 
					We spent the meeting working on the main structure.  We got the center piece finished, and attached it 
					to the bottom crush structure piece.  However, we realized the center piece to outside connection may be <em>too</em> strong,
					and doesn't absorb shock well.  We plan to try cutting one or more of the toothpicks on this connection.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td> 11-3-2015 </td>
				<td> 1.5 hr </td>
				<td> 3<sup>rd</sup> (and final) Build Day </td>
				<td> 
					After the unexpected announcement that we would <strong>not</strong> be able to finish our egg drops at home after the meeting, we 
					started rushing to finish by the end of the period.  We were able to finish both halves and the center, join them, and get most of the
					spikes attached to the outside before we ran out of time.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td> 11-4-2015 </td>
				<td> 1 hr </td>
				<td> Drop Day </td>
				<td> 
					Along with every other group, we dropped our final design.  Happily, despite our worst fears, the crush structure worked as designed.  
					When we inspected the device after the fall, the outer shell was mangled, but the egg was unharmed!  Encouraged, we also did the second,
					higher drop, and were again successful.  We earned the extra credit points, and now our device hangs from the ceiling above the center table!  Huzzah!
