				<td> 
					We decided on a cube around a double pyramid for our inner shell and a crush structure with a solid core and spikes to
					absorb shock for our outer shell. Alex, Hunter, and Drew immediately started building,
					and Jamie spent the first half of the class frantically making Pugh charts to keep up with their reasoning before joining in.
					By the end of the day, part of the crush structure and inner shell had been built.
