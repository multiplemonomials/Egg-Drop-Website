			Shack with Supporting Structure
		</h3>
		<span class="subtitle">(Jamie and Drew)</span>
		<p>
			Drew and I decided to create a rectangular prism of solid toothpicks to hold the egg and protect it from shock.  We also added
			triangular pyramids and rectangular prisms (we couldn't decide which) on the sides to absorb impact and channel it to 
			the corners of the center prism.  We only had time to finish ons side's outer structure, but we dropped it on that side.

			Pyramidal Structure
		</h3>
		<span class="subtitle">(Alex)</span>
		<p>
			Alex decided to model his after a wooden puzzle consisting of several strips of pyramid-like shapes which assembled into a sphere.
			He was not able to finish, but despite being only a thin rigid shell around the egg, his protection device still worked.

		<h3>
			Spike Shock Absorbers
		</h3>
		<span class="subtitle">(Hunter)</span>
		<p>
			Hunter decided to create a small frame around the egg with many long (>10 cm) spikes protruding out.  He theorized that those would flex and break during landing, and cushion his device's landing.

		<h3>
			The Results
		</h3>
		<p>
			We were apprehensive and not fully prepared by the end of class, but when each of us dropped his device, all three of the eggs SURVIVED!  While the test drop
			was less than half the height of the actual, it was still a promising start to our project.
			<br>
			We learned several things from our tests:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Not that much was actually needed to protect the egg, at least in the smaller drop.  It seemed like if you could direct force around the egg and keep if from directly touching the
			ground, it would survive. </li>
			<li>Jamie and Drew's shack idea was buildable and functional. Someone later pointed out that it was against the rules because it entirely covered the egg, though. </li>
			<li>Alex's egg holder pyramid idea was a winner, as it protected his egg with almost no outer structure. </li>
			<li>Hunter's spike shock absorber was also quite effective </li>
		</ol>
