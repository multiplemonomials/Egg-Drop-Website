		<h2>Final Design</h2>
		
		<p>
			We opted for a device with the attributes we had identified as best during testing: a solid, diamond-shaped inner structure, a weak crushable outer shell,
			and thin spikes on the outside.  We surmised that this outer shell would deform on impact and absorb kinetic energy, as well as lengthen the deceleration
			distance of the egg and thereby reduce the force on it during landing.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Materials</h3>
		<ul class="materialslist">
			<li> Several boxes of toothpicks </li>
			<li> Hot glue, around 5 large sticks </li>
			<li> Raw Egg </li>
			<li> Hot glue gun </li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions</h3>
		<p class="note">
			NOTE: Make your glue joints in the crush structure strong enough to hold together, but not so strong that they will not break during landing.  Also, 
			blowing on joints as they're drying generally does more harm than good by shifting the toothpicks away from the joint.
		</p>
		<h4> Create the center structure: </h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Create a 2 toothpick wide square made of 3 toothpick thick rods.  Slather the rods and corners with glue, as this needs to be strong.</li>			
			<li>Pre-glue 8x 3 toothpick thick 1 toothpick long rods. </li>
			<li>Connect 4 of the rods to make a square pyramid, and connect the ends of the pyramid rods to the middle of the sides of the square. </li>
			<li>Place the egg in the pyramid, and construct another pyramid  from the remaining rods above it so that it touches the top of the egg.  You may have to shorten the rods with scissors so that they meet at the top. </li>
			<li>Glue this pyramid together at the top, and attach it to the bottom pyramid and the square.
			<li>Add additional braces as necessary to support the egg or correct for any unevenness </li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Build the outer shell: </h4>
		<ol start="7">
			<li>Glue a 4x4x2 structure made of 16 1x1x1 cubes of toothpicks. Use only one toothpick for each rod. Omit the center rod and the rods connecting to the center on the top layer.</li>
			<li>Glue a single toothpick vertically from each joint on the top of the structure except the center. </li>
			<li>Repeat steps 4 and 5 to build a second,identical structure. </li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Connect the pieces: </h4>
		<ol start="9">
			<li>Attach the square part of the inner shell to the center of one of the outer shell halves by the sticking-up toothpicks.</li>
			<li>Connect the bottom of the pyramidal center structure to the bottom of the outer shell with two diagonal supports made of toothpicks connected together.  Make sure that the ends of each toothpick overlap each other by a centimeter or so to make the supports strong.</li>
			<li>Repeat the previous step with the other half of the outer shell. </li>
			<li>Finish joining the two halves.  Add a perimeter of toothpicks around the edge of the middle level to connect the sticking-up toothpicks, and connect that perimeter to the reinforced square in the center with more toothpicks. </li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Add the spikes: </h4>
		<ol start="13">	
			<li>Glue three single toothpicks at varying angles outward on each of the six vertexes of the cube. </li>
			<li>Create 24 rods two toothpicks long, and glue four of them on each side on the middle square of toothpicks.  They should face upward and outward </li>
			<li>Reinforce any weak points with additional toothpicks or glue. </li>
		</ol>

		<h3>The Finished Device</h3>
		<p>
			We finished the drop device just in time, and class ended before we were able to glue on all of the spikes.  Nevertheless, we were able to get the halves joined together securely
			and the inner shell attached, so the device was more or less functional.  We initially used colored toothpicks for parts of the inner and outer shells, until we ran out.  We struggled a bit
			during build with getting the
			hot glue joints right: too little glue, and the toothpicks won't stick; too much and the joint will take forever to cool, as well as not deform properly during landing.

		<h2> The Drop </h2>
		<p>
			All of us were pretty pessimistic about the how our device would fare on Drop Day, but we were in for a surprise.  As Hunter threw it off the balcony,
			we all watched with bated breath, waiting for the inevitable failure.  However, as it hit the ground, I was encouraged by how well the frame deformed and absorbed the impact.  Could it be&hellip;
		</p>
		<p>
			My hopes were confirmed as Drew hesitantly walked over and inspected the device.  The egg had survived! Yes!  We'd done it!
		</p>
		<p>
			We were also successful in the second, higher, extra-credit drop, proving that our device could handle much more than we initially threw at it.  However, each drop left a 
			large dent in the crush structure, and I doubt that it could withstand many more drops without repairs, especially if it landed on the already-crushed spots. It's definitely
			not a very reusable device.  Luckily, it won't have to be dropped any more, as having survived its trials, it's now hanging on Mr. Corman's ceiling.

		<h3> Drop Video </h3>

			This video shows both drops, in slow motion.  Notice how little rebound there is, since the deformation of the crush structure absorbed all of the kinetic energy of the falling device.
