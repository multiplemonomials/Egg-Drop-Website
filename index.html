		<h2>Final Design</h2>
		
		<p>
			We opted for a device with the attributes we had identified as best during testing: a solid, diamond-shaped inner structure, a weak crushable outer shell,
			and thin spikes on the outside.  We surmised that this outer shell would deform on impact and absorb kinetic energy, as well as lengthen the deceleration
			distance of the egg and thereby reduce the force on it during landing.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Materials</h3>
		<ul class="materialslist">
			<li> Several boxes of toothpicks </li>
			<li> Hot glue, around 5 large sticks </li>
			<li> Egg </li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Instructions</h3>
		<p> TBD </p>

		<h3>The Finished Device</h3>
		<p>
			We finished the drop device just in time, and class ended before we were able to glue on all of the spikes.  Nevertheless, we were able to get the halves joined together securely
			and the inner shell attached, so the device was more or less functional.  We initially used colored toothpicks for parts of the inner and outer shells, until we ran out.  We struggled a bit
			during build with getting the
			hot glue joints right: too little glue, and the toothpicks won't stick; too much and the joint will take forever to cool, as well as not deform properly during landing.

		<h2> The Drop </h2>
		<p>
			All of us were pretty pessimistic about the how our device would fare on Drop Day, but we were in for a surprise.  As Hunter threw it off the balcony,
			we all watched with bated breath, waiting for the inevitable failure.  However, as it hit the ground, I was encouraged by how well the frame deformed and absorbed the impact.  Could it be&hellip;
		</p>
		<p>
			My hopes were confirmed as Drew hesitantly walked over and inspected the device.  The egg had survived! Yes!  We'd done it!
		</p>
		<p>
			We were also successful in the second, higher, extra-credit drop, proving that our device could handle much more than we initially threw at it.  However, each drop left a 
			large dent in the crush structure, and I doubt that it could withstand many more drops without repairs, especially if it landed on the already-crushed spots. It's definitely
			not a very reusable device.  Luckily, it won't have to be dropped any more, as having survived its trials, it's now hanging on Mr. Corman's ceiling.

			This video shows both drops, in slow motion.  Notice how little rebound there is, since the deformation of the crush structure absorbed all of the kinetic energy of the falling device.
